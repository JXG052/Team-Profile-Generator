# Team Profile Generator

  ## Description
  
 My motivation for this project was to put into practice my learnings from week 12 of the edx bootcamp, specifically, Test Driven Development and OOP. As of writing this README the, application is unfinshed, I am struggling with how to use command line arguments to obtain the information I need.
